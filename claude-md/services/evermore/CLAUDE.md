# evermore (CRUD)
- Validation of real data happens here, not in midnight_models.
- Every session operation runs in a transaction: with self._session.begin_nested():
- Keep the try: self._session.commit() + handle_integrity_error(...) block as written in each function,
  even when it repeats. Don't extract it.
